# OVR Design Team

---

## Proposed workflow
- The project manager creates a user story as a new issue.
- User Story is refined by community and moved onto the wireframe board
- Wireframes are being created and updated
- When done, wireframes will be reviewed by the community or admin
- When finished, the wireframe issue will be moved to UI
- The UI team implements the designs with the given UI patterns from the library
- The screens are being reviewed by the community or admin
- When done, the screens are released for development by the Frontend team.

## Rules
- Do not self-assign. Ask to be assigned
- Feedback on wireframes or designs are given through Figma or Github, not slack
- Change Requests or design bugs are raised as Github issues
- Be fair and respect everybody's work
- Give praise
- Respect boundaries
- Any issues, contact the admin (@supernoir).
